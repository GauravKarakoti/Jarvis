Gaurav : Meaning.
Jarvis : You want me to explain the meaning of those methods. Here's a brief explanation:
1. Rebalance your portfolio: This means adjusting the mix of investments in your portfolio to maintain your target asset allocation, ensuring you're not over-exposed to a particular asset class or sector.
2. Average down: This involves investing more money in the same shares at a lower price, reducing your overall cost per share and potentially increasing your returns when the market recovers.
3. Diversify: Spreading your investments across different asset classes, sectors, or geographic regions can help reduce risk and increase potential returns by minimizing exposure to any one particular market or sector.
4. Long-term approach: Focusing on the long-term performance of your investments rather than short-term fluctuations can help you ride out market volatility and avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term market movements.
5. Consult a financial advisor: A financial advisor can provide personalized guidance and help you create a customized investment strategy tailored to your specific financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon.
